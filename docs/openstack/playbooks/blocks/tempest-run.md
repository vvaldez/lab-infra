# Ansible Playbook: Tempest run

This playbook will:

- If `remove` is `true` then delete any existing Tempest workspace found at `/home/stack/tempest/tempest-{{ site_name }}`
- If there is not an existing Tempest workspace named `tempest-{{ site_name }}`, then:
  - Initialize the Tempest workspace named `tempest-{{ site_name }}`
  - Source `/home/stack/{{ site_name }}rc` and grab the Neutron network UUID of `{{ network_name }}`
  - Generate the initial `tempest.conf` file using `discover-tempest-config`
  - Modify the generated `tempest.conf` file with `crudini` to match working settings
  - Download the RHEL7 qcow2 to use for launching instances, if it does not already exist
  - If any of the above steps fail, delete the non-functional Tempest workspace `tempest-{{ site_name }}`
- Create `/home/stack/ansible-generated-logs` if it does not exist
- Initialize a tempest saved state using `tempest cleanup --init-saved-state`
- Run Tempest smoke tests
- Generate the HTML output into `/home/stack/ansible-generated-logs/tempest-{{ id }}.html`. `{{ id }}` is an autogenerated ID number for the Tempest run.
- Show the brief results of the Tempest run in a debug statement
